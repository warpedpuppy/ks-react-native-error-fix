# chatApp

chatApp is created with React Native, developed with Expo. It provides a chat interface and options for users to send images, take a photo, which are saved to Google firestore, and share their location.

## set up
- Start by making sure you have the most recent version of Node installed, check with node -v in your terminal.
- If you want to use your mobile device to develop/test your app, you will need to install the Expo app from your device's app store.

## scripts

``` npm install expo-cli --global ```

Download Expo on your OS to run, you will need to make a free account with Expo.

``` npm start/expo start ```

This script will run the expo program, open a new window to work in. 
- Note that I usually set my connection to tunnel vs. LAN for simplicity.
- If you use LAN, make sure that your testing device and your OS are running on the same internet connection.
